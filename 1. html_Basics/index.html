    Inside an HTML document we can have multiple html tags with different lang attribute values.
    For eg.:
    hindi language for the lang attribute, so if the default langauge of our browser is hindi the html block with 
    lang="en" will be ignored and the html block with lang="hi" will be rendered.
    
    <html lang="en"> ignored

    </html> 
    
    <html lang="hi"> rendered

    </html>
