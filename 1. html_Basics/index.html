<!-- DOCTYPE comment is a type declaration statement that tells the browser that the current file is a HTML5 document -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- purpose of html : structure the webpage, not for styling the website -->
<!-- html is not a programming language because no decision making capabilities-->
<!-- html is very forgiving, doesn't check for any errors. No facility of checking the presence of an error -->

<!-- <html> is the root element of the html document -->
<!-- Inside the HTML tag there's "lang" attribute that allows to specify the language of the current web page -->


<!-- 
    Inside an HTML document we can have multiple html tags with different lang attribute values.
    For eg.:
    hindi language for the lang attribute, so if the default langauge of our browser is hindi the html block with 
    lang="en" will be ignored and the html block with lang="hi" will be rendered.
    
    <html lang="en">  -> ignored
        <head>...</head>
        <body>...</body>
    </html> 
    
    <html lang="hi"> -> rendered
        <head>...</head>
        <body>...</body>
    </html> 
-->

<html lang="en"> <!-- lang attribute specifies the type of the content language the html5 document contains-->

<head>
    <!-- The <head> tag contains additional information about the webpage wrapped in meta tags, links of various files i.e 
    the stylesheet, title of the webpage and so on. -->
    
    <!-- head contains the internal styles, scripts, meta info and title of the webpage -->
    <!-- meta tags contains data about the webpage -->

    <!-- charset tells the browser the characterset that'll be present in the webpage -->
    
    <!-- 
        meta tags contains information about the content of the document, the kind of information the webpage content contains that 
        tells the search engine about the page. Used for SEO(s).
	-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- character set : character encoding 8 bits, supports emojis and other updated stuffs -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <!-- used for responsiveness of the webpage, tells the browser to 
 										scale the content based on viewport -->
    
    <!-- <title> specifies the title of the webpage in the browser tab. -->
    <title>HTML_BASICS</title>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- <body> tag contains the content of the webpage, the content that should be rendered in the webpage. -->
    <!-- the content that is to be rendered is present here. The content is rendered within the viewport-->

    <h1>
        <!-- heading tag -->
        <!-- importance : h1 > h2 > h3 > h4 > h5 > h6 -->
    </h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <h3></h3>
    <h4></h4>
    <h5></h5>
    <h6></h6>
    <!-- 
        heading, paragraph tags have a default styling. The padding, margins, font-weight is somewhat different from whatever written without tags. 
        Moreover, after every heading, paragraph tag, a new line is added. 
        The content inside the tag also has added semantics.
    -->

    <p> 
    <!-- This is a Paragraph tag.
         used for non-formatted paragraph content, Browsers automatically add a single blank line(new line) before and after each <p> element. 
         But it doesn’t support extra blank spaces and line breaks.
         There's a line-break after the p tag ends.
         Inside <p> we can use tags like :
            1. <code> -> (Defines a piece of computer code), 
            2. <samp> -> (Defines sample output from a computer program), 
            3. <kbd> -> (Defines keyboard input), 
            4. <var> -> (Defines a variable).
    -->
    </p>
    
    The Line won't have a Line Break. Line after another Line.

    <pre> 
        <!-- 
            text in a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks. 
            The text will be displayed exactly as written in the HTML source code.
        -->
    </pre>
    
    <!-- (line) break tag, to add a new line. It is actually an empty container. -->

         Horizontal Tag -> to add a horizontal line 
         (a thin container with margin and outline).

        Block vs Inline Elements :
        Blocks Elements : Take up the entire horizontal space, the whole width of the body. eg.: <h1>, <div>, <p>. 
        Inline Elements : Take up the space required for the content. Takes the width of the content. eg.: <a>, <span>, <img>, <button>.

    </span>
    
    <!-- 
        To center a child element that is a span element inside a parent element that is necessarily a div element, we can use : (text-align:center;)
        Property to be applied on the parent element which has to be as a block element. 
        eg.: we have an image inside a div which has width of 100vw, we can do : 
                    div { text-align : center; } → to center the image inside the div.
